# Lock-and-Load
This is an Escape room theme game made with Python 2.7


Instruction:
You are locked in a room. There is **only one way** to escape which is through a combination locked door. Search around the room with your cursor to find minigames to play. Some of the minigames can be **deadly** so try your best to win every one. For each minigame you win you will receive a hint for one of the numbers to the combination. Be careful though, the hints provided can be tricky to decipher as well. Follow the instructions **CAREFULLY** to get out of the room in under 30 minutes. The sooner you get out, the higher your final score will be.

A leaderboard is available for different user
